A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (24 x 8 mm), (Note 1) is charged with (R,R)-(-)-N,N'-bis(3,5-di-tertbutylsalicylidene)-1,2-cyclohexanediaminocobalt(II) (1.51 g, 2.5 mmol, 0.025 equiv (Note 2). 1,5-Diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (247 μL, 2 mmol, 0.02 equiv (Note 3) and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (8.66 mL, 82.5 mmol, 0.825 equiv) are added to the flask via syringe.The mixture is diluted with diethyl ether (250 mL (Note 4) to afford a dark brown solution and stirring is initiated at 500 rpm. Styrene oxide (11.4 mL, 100 mmol, 1.0 equiv (Note 5) and benzoyl fluoride (5.99 mL, 55 mmol, 0.55 equiv) are both added via syringe.The reaction is allowed to stir open to air for 15 min (Note 6) at room temperature (Note 7).The flask is then capped with a polyethylene cap and secured with Parafilm wrap (Note 8).The reaction is stirred at 500 rpm for 13-14 h at room temperature (Note 9), and then quenched by the addition of methanolic ammonia (7 N, 150 mL) via syringe (Note 10).The solution is allowed to stir for 2-3 h or until the disappearance of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropan-2-yl benzoate, as monitored by TLC (Notes 11 and 12).The reaction is then transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel (Note 13) and washed with aqueous 1M NaOH (3 x 200 mL). The combined aqueous portions are then extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 100 mL). The combined organic portions are dried over 10 g of anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporator (25 °C, 100 mmHg, then 60 mmHg) to afford a dark brown oil.The crude product is charged onto a column (75 mm x 300 mm) packed with 200 g SiO2 (Note 14) as a slurry with hexanes.The loaded column is topped with a 1 cm layer of sand and 75 mL fractions are collected, eluting with 500 mL hexanes, 625 mL of 5% diethyl ether-hexanes, 625 mL of 10% diethyl ether-hexanes, 375 mL of 15% diethyl ether-hexanes, and then 1625 mL of 20% diethyl ether-hexanes.

Dirhodium(II) tetrakis[ε-caprolactamate] acetonitrile solvate, Rh2(cap)4(CH3CN)2 (1). An oven-dried 250-mL, single-necked (24/40 joint) round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated stir-bar is charged with dirhodium(II) tetraacetate (2.00 g, 4.5 mmol) (Note 1), e-caprolactam (11.84 g, 104.6 mmol) (Note 2), and dry chlorobenzene (110 mL) (Note 3). The flask is fitted with a Soxhlet extraction apparatus (Note 4) containing a thimble with 30 g of an oven-dried Na2CO3 and sand mixture in a 3:1 ratio (Note 5). An additional 50 mL of chlorobenzene is added to partially fill the thimble-chamber of the Soxhlet apparatus. The mixture is refluxed at 185 °C (external temperature) open to the atmosphere (Note 6), and after only 15 min the color of the solution turns from green to dark blue. After 10 h the vessel is removed from the oil bath, the Soxhlet extraction apparatus is removed, and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to yield a blue, glass-like solid residue. 2-Propanol (100 mL) (Note 7) is added to the same flask, and the solid residue is mixed vigorously with 2-propanol for 30 seconds using a metal spatula to dissolve chlorobenzene that is entrapped in the residue (Note 8). The 2-propanol is evaporated from the solid residue under reduced pressure to give a purple powder suitable for filtration (Note 9). Acetone (100 mL) is added to dissolve excess e-caprolactam contained in the powder, and the solid is gravity-filtered through a Büchner funnel and then washed with an additional 50 mL of acetone (Note 10). The filtered purple solid is transferred to a pre-weighed, 250-mL round-bottomed flask and dried under high vacuum (0.1 mmHg) for 1 h to yield 3.52 g of a dull purple powder (Note 11). To render the powder catalytically active (Note 12) the solid is recrystallized from 66 mL of boiling acetonitrile/methanol (10:1) (Note 13) to give 1.65 g (50% yield) of Rh2(cap)4(CH3CN)2 (1) (Note 14) as shiny deep purple crystals.B.

The resulting suspension is sonicated at 20 °C with gentle swirling until homogeneous (Note 18). tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (3.39 g, 22.5 mmol) (Note 19) is added as a solid to the reaction mixture. The flask is equipped with a magnetic stir bar (Note 20). After about 3 min of stirring, a white precipitate begins to form. The reaction is stirred for 30 min, at which time water (100 mL) is added to ensure complete product precipitation. The white clay-like substance is scraped from the glass walls of the Erlenmeyer flask, filtered under vacuum, and then dried overnight under vacuum (0.01 mmHg) at 20 °C to yield 6.83 g (98%) of 3 as a white powder (Note 21).C. (3β)-3-[[(1,1-dimethylethyl)dimethylsilyl]-oxy]-Androst-5-ene-7,17-dione (4). A 200-mL, Erlenmeyer flask (24/40 joint) containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is charged with 3 (8.04 g, 20.0 mmol), 1 (146 mg, 0.20 mmol, 1.00 mol %), and 1,2-dichloroethane (40 mL) (Note 22). The suspension is sonicated for 5 min at 20 °C with occasional gentle swirling (Note 18). After addition of T-HYDRO (14.3 mL, 99.5 mmol, 5.0 equiv) in one portion (Note 23), the flask containing the reaction mixture is equipped with a septum containing an outlet needle (Note 24) and its contents are stirred at 40 °C (external temperature) (Note 25). The color of the solution turns from purple to dark red after about 2 min following addition of T-HYDRO. After 24 h the mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (30 °C, 10 mmHg) (Note 26). The product is purified by column chromatography (Note 27). Fractions containing the product are combined, and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (30 °C, 30 mmHg). The remaining white solid is dissolved in diethyl ether (20 mL) at room temperature. The solution is heated to 35 °C and then cooled to room temperature whereupon a white powder crystallizes from the solution. Diethyl ether is removed using a pipette. The above washing procedure is repeated twice. The resulting white powder is collected and dried overnight under reduced pressure at room temperature (60 °C, 4 mmHg) to yield 4 (5.50 g, 66 %) (Notes 28 and 29).

Anhydrous DMF (2.28 mL, 2.15 g, 29.3 mmol, 0.1 equiv) (Note 2) is added and the mixture is heated to 35 Â¿C with a heating mantle. SOCl2 (25.6 mL, 41.9 g, 352 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Note 2) is added through the addition funnel over 30 min at such a rate that the internal temperature is maintained at <40 Â¿C (Note 3). The resulting light brown solution is stirred at 40 Â¿C and monitored by HPLC until the reaction is complete (Notes 4, 5, and 6). A three-necked, 1-L round-bottomed flask is equipped with an 8-cm mechanical stirrer, a temperature probe, a 250-mL addition funnel, and a nitrogen gas inlet adaptor. The flask is charged with methylamine solution (40 wt% in water or 11.5M, 128 mL, 114 g, 1470 mmol, 5.0 equiv) (Note 7) and cooled to 5 Â¿C with an ice bath.

A three-necked, 500-mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 3-cm magnetic stir bar, a temperature probe, a 50-mL addition funnel, and a reflux condenser with a nitrogen gas inlet adaptor (Note 1). The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen for a minimum of 15 min and charged with 50 mL of Eaton's reagent (Note 11). 2-(4-Chlorophenyl)-N-methylacetamide (10.0 g, 54.5 mmol) is charged in portions, resulting in an exotherm from 23 Â¿C to 29 Â¿C (Note 12). Paraformaldehyde (1.98 g, 65.3 mmol, 1.2 equiv) (Notes 13 and 14) is added and the reaction mixture is heated at 80 Â¿C with a heating mantle for 2 h to afford a brown solution [Caution! The reaction is exothermic (Note 15)], at which point HPLC analysis indicates complete consumption of starting material 2 (Notes 4 and 16). The reaction mixture is cooled to 5 Â¿C with an ice bath and water (50 mL) is added through the addition funnel over 30 min while maintaining the internal temperature at <25 Â¿C. Caution! The addition of water is exothermic. Isopropyl acetate (IPAc) (50 mL) is added and the mixture is cooled to 5 Â¿C with an ice bath. The pH of the mixture is adjusted to 8Â¿8.5 using 19M NaOH solution (~48-49 mL) while maintaining the internal temperature at <25 Â¿C with an ice bath. Caution! The addition of NaOH is exothermic. The solid precipitate is filtered off with a BÂ¿chner funnel. The filter cake is washed with IPAc (10 mL). The filtrate mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with IPAc (50 mL) and the organic phases are combined. The combined organic phases are concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 Â¿C, 30 mmHg) to afford a brown residue. The residue is dissolved in EtOAc (50 mL) and charged on a column (5 Â¿20 cm) of 200 g of silica gel (Note 17). The column is eluted with 1 L of EtOAc and fraction collection (50-mL fractions) is begun after 500 mL of solvent is eluted. Elution is continued with 1 L of 10% MeOH/EtOAc and the desired product is obtained in fractions 12-22 (Notes 18 and 19), which are concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 Â¿C, 30 mmHg) to afford a yellow oil. The oil is dried under vacuum (30 mmHg) at ambient temperature (20Â¿25 Â¿C) for a minimum of 24 h to afford 9.00-9.07 g (85%) of a light yellow solid (Notes 4, 20, and 21).
V89P0055	Dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene: Multi-gram Synthesis of a Bidentate Ligand	A. 5,6,11,12-Tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene (1). A 1-L, three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 4-cm egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser, an internal thermometer and a 250-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel (capped with a rubber septum), is flame-dried and purged with argon. Degassed THF (200 mL) (Note 1) is added and subsequently granular lithium (6.63 g, 956 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (Note 2). The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of freshly sublimed α,α'-dibromo-o-xylene (101 g, 382 mmol) in degassed THF (150 mL) (Note 3). This solution is then added dropwise to the stirred suspension of granular lithium over a period of 1.5 h, which begins to reflux after 20 min. During the period of addition the internal temperature of the mixture is kept between 65 °C and 70 °C (Note 4). After complete addition, the mixture is refluxed for 2 h (oil bath) until TLC-analysis indicates complete consumption of the substrate (Notes 5, 6 and 7). The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and is then, for removal of residual lithium, filtered through a fritted glass funnel (5.0 cm diameter, porosity 0). The funnel is subsequently rinsed with THF (100 mL) (Note 1). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation at a bath temperature of 40 °C (255-225 mmHg) and then at 50 °C (7.5 mmHg) for 1 h in order to remove THF (Note 8). Dichloromethane (700 mL) is added to the residue. After stirring for 2 min, insoluble material (Note 9) is removed by filtration with a fritted glass funnel (8.0 cm diameter, porosity 4) filled with silica gel (100 g) (Note 10). The residue is washed with dichloromethane (700 mL) and the filtrate dried over Na2SO4 (50 g). The latter is removed by filtration and the filtrate concentrated at 40 °C by rotary evaporation (675-525 mmHg and then 15 mmHg) for 1 h. The crude product remains as a pale yellow semifluidic mass (40.5 g), which solidifies under vacuum overnight (25 °C, 0.3 mmHg). Finally, the product is purified by Kugelrohr distillation (air bath temperature 130-175 °C, 0.25 mmHg) (Note 11) to yield pure 1 (19.6 g, 49%) as colorless plates (Note 12).B. 5,11-Dibromo-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]-cyclooctene (2).Under an atmosphere of argon in a flame-dried, 500-mL, three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condensor and a 4-cm egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar, 1 (19.2 g, 92.3 mmol) is dissolved in carbon tetrachloride (200 mL) (Note 13). NBS (35.3 g, 198.4 mmol, 2.15 equiv) (Notes 14 and 15) is added, and the stirred mixture is then refluxed at 85 °C (oil bath temperature). After 2 h NMR analysis (Note 16) indicates complete consumption of the starting material 1 (Note 17). The hot suspension (65 °C) is filtered through a fritted glass funnel (8.0 cm diameter, porosity 3), and the remaining succinimide is washed with carbon tetrachloride (400 mL) (Note 18). The solvent of the filtrate is evaporated under gradually reduced pressure (40 °C, 225 to 18 mmHg). A pale yellow residue remains, which is scraped off the inner wall of the flask, poured into a fritted glass funnel (7.0 cm diameter, porosity 3), washed with distilled water (300 mL) and dried overnight under vacuum (25 °C, 0.3 mmHg) to give 35.4 g of crude 2 as a pale yellow solid (Note 19).C. Dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene (3). Under an atmosphere of argon in a flame-dried, 250-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 2 (34.1 g crude product) is dissolved in THF (150 mL) (Note 1). Under an atmosphere of argon in a second flame-dried, 500-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, potassium tert-butoxide (41.6 g, 371 mmol, 4 equiv, assuming 100% purity of 2) (Note 20) is dissolved in THF (100 mL) (Note 1). The resulting cloudy solution is then cooled with an ice bath. At 0 °C the solution of 2 is transferred through a teflon tube (1.5 mm internal diameter) over a period of 15 min into the 500-mL flask. During the period of addition the color changes from orange to brown and finally to black. Then the ice bath is removed, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred for 2 h until TLC-analysis indicates complete consumption of the dibromide 2 (Notes 21 and 22). Distilled water (15 mL) is added and the black mixture is poured onto a pad of silica gel (diameter 10 cm x 4 cm height) that has already been wetted with diethyl ether. The pad is rinsed with 700 mL of diethyl ether, and the eluent is collected directly as a single fraction, dried over Na2SO4 (40 g), filtered and concentrated at 40 °C by rotary evaporation (675 to 75 mmHg) and then at 15 mmHg for 1 h. The crude product remains as a brown solid (18.5 g) (Note 23), which is scraped off the inner wall of the flask and dried overnight under vacuum (25 °C, 0.3 mmHg). Purification by Kugelrohr distillation (air bath temperature 130-145 °C, 0.2 mmHg) (Note 24, 25) affords 13.0 g (69%, two steps from 1) of dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene (3) as colorless plates (Note 26).

The reaction mixture is heated to reflux with an oil bath (bath temperature 130 ºC) for 4 h and then is allowed to cool down to room temperature (Notes 6 and 7). The reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure on rotary evaporator (20-30 mmHg, bath temperature 40-45 ºC). Water (20 mL) is added to the concentrate and the mixture is heated with an oil bath (90~100 °C bath temperature) under air for 1 h and cooled down to room temperature (Note 8). The resulting mixture is filtered through a Büchner funnel. The solid product is washed with water (40 ml).

The flask is flushed with nitrogen via a nitrogen line inlet and charged with anhydrous THF (60 mL) via a 60 mL syringe (Note 2). The stirred homogeneous solution (Note 3) is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath (−78 °C bath temp), and vinylmagnesium chloride solution (20.6 mL, 33.0 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is added dropwise over 20 min via a syringe. The resulting clear yellow solution is stirred at −78 °C for 1 h and then at 0 °C in an ice bath for 30 min (Note 4). The reaction mixture is quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (30 mL) and diluted with H2O (30 mL). After being warmed up to ambient temperature, the mixture is transferred to a 250 mL separatory funnel. Additional diethyl ether (20 mL) is used to assist transfer. The aqueous layer is separated and further extracted with diethyl ether (2 x 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous NaCl solution (50 mL), dried over sodium sulfate (20 g), filtered through a 150 mL coarse porosity sintered glass funnel, and concentrated using a rotary evaporator (25 °C, 25 mmHg) to afford a yellow oil (Note 5).

Phosphorus trichloride (10.5 mL, 16.5 g, 15 equiv) and anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (19 µL, 18 mg, 0.24 mmol, 0.03 equiv) are added by syringes through the septum. The reaction mixture is stirred (Note 8) at 50 °C in an oil bath for 30 min, during which time it becomes a colorless homogeneous solution. Excess phosphorus trichloride is removed via vacuum distillation (Notes 9 and 10) and azeotropic removal with toluene (2 x 3 mL) under high vacuum (see photograph) (Notes 11 and 12) to afford the phosphochloridite as an oily foam. A separate oven-dried 250 mL round-bottomed flask is charged with a 2.5 cm Teflon-coated magnetic oval stir bar and 5H-dibenz[b,f ]azepine (1.70 g, 8.80 mmol, 1.1 equiv). The flask is fitted with a rubber septum with a nitrogen line inlet and flushed with nitrogen. Anhydrous THF (47 mL) is added by syringe, and the stirred orange solution is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath (−78 °C bath temp) (Note 13). n-Butyllithium (5.50 mL, 8.80 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is then added dropwise over 10 min with a syringe, and the resulting dark blue solution is stirred at −78 °C for 1 h. The phosphochloridite prepared as above is dissolved in anhydrous THF (37 mL) and added to the deprotonated 5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine solution at −78 °C dropwise via a cannula over 20 min. Additional anhydrous THF (10 mL) is used to assist transfer. The dark blue solution is stirred for 12 h while being gradually warmed to ambient temperature (Note 14). Silica gel (20 g) is added to the orange reaction mixture, and the resulting slurry is carefully concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 25 mmHg). Flash chromatography on silica gel yields (R)-L (2.96-3.07 g, 73-75%) as a white solid (Note 15).C. (S,E)-2-(1-Phenylpenta-1,4-dien-3-yl)naphthalene (2). A screw cap 100 mL cylindrical polyethylene bottle (diameter: 4.5 cm, height: 9.5 cm) with a 4 cm Teflon-coated magnetic cylindrical stir bar is charged with bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)diiridium dichloride (0.725 g, 1.08 mmol, 0.04 equiv), (R)-L (2.19 g, 4.32 mmol, 0.16 equiv) and 1,4-dioxane (34 mL) (Note 16). The resulting dark brown solution (see photograph) is stirred for 15 min (Note 17). 1-(Naphthalen-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-ol (1) (4.97 g, 27.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv), potassium trans-styryltrifluoroborate (8.51 g, 40.5 mmol, 1.5 equiv), tetrabutylammonium bromide (0.87 g, 2.7 mmol, 0.1 equiv) and potassium hydrogen difluoride (3.16 g, 40.5 mmol, 1.5 equiv) are sequentially added, and additional 1,4-dioxane (2.0 mL) is added to rinse the reaction vessel wall. To the resulting stirred dark-yellow heterogeneous mixture is added trifluoroacetic acid (5.17 mL, 7.70 g, 67.5 mmol, 2.5 equiv) dropwise. The red heterogeneous mixture is vigorously stirred for 6 h, during which time it gradually turns light yellow (Note 18). Upon completion of the reaction, excess trifluoroacetic acid is quenched by addition of triethylamine (5 mL), and the heterogeneous mixture is filtered through a short silica pad (Note 19). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 25 mmHg). The concentrate is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to afford 2 (5.74 g, 79%) as a white solid (Notes 20 and 21).
V92P0013	Synthesis of 4,4-dimethoxybut-1-yne	4,4-Dimethoxybut-1-yne (1).

The glass stopper is replaced with a rubber septum fitted with a thermocouple temperature probe, and Et2O (40 mL) (Note 3) is added through the addition funnel. The mixture is heated at reflux (preheated oil bath, temperature 50 °C) for 10 min (Note 4) and then allowed to cool to room temperature by removing the oil bath. The addition funnel is charged with a solution of propargyl bromide (25.1 g, 211 mmol, 1.3 equiv) (Note 5) in 80 mL of Et2O (Note 6). The propargyl bromide solution is cautiously added dropwise to the reaction flask (Note 7) over 1.5 h at a rate that maintains the reaction mixture at gentle reflux (see photo) (Note 8). The dark brown reaction mixture is next heated at reflux in an oil bath for an additional hour and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Stirring is halted to allow the excess aluminum powder to settle and the brown supernatant solution is transferred via cannula to a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 30 x 15 mm, Teflon-coated, oval magnetic stir bar, a rubber septum, a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a rubber septum, and a nitrogen inlet adapter (see photo). The solids in the original flask are rinsed with two 100-mL portions of Et2O, which are transferred via cannula to the 1-L flask. The cannula is then removed from the rubber septum and replaced with a thermocouple temperature probe. The dark green-brown solution (Note 9) is cooled to -73 °C (internal temperature) using an acetone/dry ice bath, and a solution of trimethyl orthoformate (HC(OMe)3) (17.9 mL, 17.2 g, 162 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 10) in 30 mL of Et2O is added via the addition funnel over 50 min while the internal temperature of the reaction mixture is kept below -65 °C. The addition funnel is rinsed with 5 mL of Et2O. The resulting gray suspension is stirred at -73 °C (internal temperature) for 15 min and 160 mL of deionized water is then added via the addition funnel over 45 min (Note 11). The acetone/dry ice bath is replaced by a room temperature water bath and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 20 °C over 30 min. The contents of the flask are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with Et2O (4 x 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with 5 M aqueous NaOH solution (140 mL), deionized water (2 x 100 mL), and saturated NaCl solution (100 mL), dried over 20 g of K2CO3, and filtered through filter paper into a 1-L round-bottomed flask containing a 30 x 15 mm, Teflon-coated, oval magnetic stir bar. The solution is concentrated to a volume of approximately 40 mL by distillation at 34-35 °C through a distillation head with a 10-cm condenser side arm. The resulting yellow solution is transferred to a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask containing a 13 x 8 mm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar and equipped with a Perkin triangle. Distillation of the residual solvents is carried out at 20 °C, 300 mmHg and subsequently the pressure is reduced to 75 mmHg and the mixture heated in a 90 °C oil bath. A forerun of ca. 4 mL (bp 20-62 °C, 75 mmHg) and a main fraction containing the desired product of ca. 15 mL (bp 62-67 °C, 75 mmHg) are collected (see photo). The distillation head is rinsed with 5 mL of pentane and the washings are combined with the forerun. The resulting solution and the residue in the original distillation flask (ca. 4 mL) are combined, transferred to a 25-mL, round-bottomed flask containing a 13 x 8 mm, Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar and equipped with a Perkin triangle, and distilled at 75 mmHg. After the volatile solvents have evaporated, a forerun of ca. 1 mL (bp 20-62 °C, 75 mmHg) and a main fraction containing the desired product of ca. 1 mL (bp 62-67 °C, 75 mmHg) are collected. The main fractions from each distillation are combined to provide a total yield of 14.3-14.6 g of 4,4-dimethoxybut-1-yne (1) (77-79%) as a colorless liquid (Note 12).

An oven-dried 100-mL single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (oval, 25 mm x 15 mm) is charged with 2-bromoacetophenone (2.7 mL, 4.0 g, 20 mmol) (Note 1) and phenylhydrazine (2.4 mL, 2.6 g, 24 mmol) (Note 2) via syringe, and stirring is started. Phosphoric acid (10.0 mL) (Note 3) is added slowly over 1 min, and the mixture is stirred for 50 min (Note 4). Polyphosphoric acid (56.7 g, Note 5) is added to the reaction mixture slowly over 30 min with continuous stirring (Note 6). The reaction flask is equipped with a Dimroth condenser, and is placed in a pre-heated oil bath (85 ºC). The bath temperature is raised to 120 °C within 1 h under air atmosphere (Note 7). The resulting mixture is stirred at 120 °C for an additional 2 h, and then carefully poured into ice water (90 g ice, 20 mL water) in a 300 mL beaker (Note 8) with stirring by means of a glass rod (Note 9). The remaining crude product in the reaction flask is rinsed with water (3 x 10 mL) (Note 10) and dichloromethane (3 x 10 mL). All rinses are transferred to the beaker. The resulting mixture is stirred by means of a glass rod for 30 min (Note 11), and then poured into 500-mL separatory funnel. The beaker is rinsed with dichloromethane (3 x 10 mL), water (3 x 10 mL), and again dichloromethane (100 mL). All rinses are transferred to the separatory funnel. The funnel is shaken, and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is further extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 100 mL). The combined organic extracts are concentrated by rotary evaporation (37 °C, 52 mmHg). The resulting dark-brown residues are purified by column chromatography (4.5-cm diameter x 16-cm packed height) with 81 g of silica gel (Note 12) in 10% ethyl acetate-hexane (1:9 ethyl acetate:hexane). At this point, 1400 mL is collected with elution of 10% ethyl acetate-hexane (1:9 ethyl acetate:hexane). The eluent containing the product is concentrated by rotary evaporation (37 °C, 20 mmHg) to afford an orange-yellow oil and dried at 7 mmHg for 1 h. This oil is cooled in an ice-water bath, and hexane (20 mL) is added with stirring by means of a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 25 mm x 8 mm) for 1 h to afford an off-white powder. The resulting powder is collected by suction filtration on a funnel, washed with ice-cold hexane (3 x 5 mL), dried for 5 h at 0.2 mmHg to provide the crude material as a pale yellow powder (3.5-3.7 g, 64-68%) (Note 13). The crude powder (3.6 g) is suspended in hexane (20 mL) and vigorously stirred for 1 h with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 25 mm x 8 mm). The resulting white powder is collected by suction filtration on a funnel, washed with ice-cold hexane (3 x 5 mL), and dried for 7 h at 0.2 mmHg to provide 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole (2.3 g, 42%) (Note 14).B. 2-(2-Bromophenyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole. An oven-dried 100-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 25 mm x 8 mm), is charged with sodium hydride (63 % dispersion in mineral oil) (0.46 g of the sodium hydride in oil, 12 mmol) (Note 15). The necks are fitted with a glass stopper, a rubber septum and a nitrogen stopcock inlet. The flask is evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Sodium hydride is washed free of mineral oil by stirring with distilled hexane (10 mL), and the supernatant liquid is decanted. This operation is repeated for three times. The remaining solvent is removed by placing the flask under vacuum (0.2 mmHg) for 15 min, after which the flask is filled with nitrogen. The glass stopper is removed and 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel attached (Figure 1). The flask is evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) (Note 16) is added to the reaction flask via syringe to form a suspension of sodium hydride, and stirring is started. The suspension is cooled to 0 °C in an ice-water bath. Figure 1. Apparatus Assembly for Step B A separate oven-dried 100 mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 25 mm x 8 mm) and charged with 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole (2.7 g, 10 mmol). The necks are fitted with a rubber septum and a nitrogen stopcock inlet. The flask is evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) (Note 16) is added via syringe, and stirring is started, to form a solution of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole. The solution of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole is transferred to the dropping funnel via cannula and additional anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) (Note 16) is added to the two-necked flask to rinse all the 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole solution to the dropping funnel. The solution of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole is added dropwise via the dropping funnel to the reaction mixture over 5 min and additional anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) (Note 16) is added to the dropping funnel to rinse all the 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole solution to the reaction mixture. Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 30 min. Dimethyl sulfate (0.99 mL, 10.3 mmol) (Note 17) is added via syringe to the reaction mixture. The mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature, at which time TLC analysis indicates the reaction has been completed (Notes 18 and 19). After adding methanol (5 mL) to quench the excess sodium hydride, the reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (36 °C, 20 mmHg) to afford a brown oil. This oil is diluted with ethyl acetate (20 mL), and then transferred to a 300-mL separatory funnel. The reaction flask is rinsed with ethyl acetate (2 x 20 mL), deionized water (2 x 20 mL), and again ethyl acetate (20 mL). All rinses are transferred to the separatory funnel. The funnel is shaken, and the layers are separated. The aqueous phase is separated out and the organic phase is washed with water (2 x 20 mL) and brine (20 mL). The organic extract is concentrated by rotary evaporation (36 °C, 20 mmHg) to afford a brown oil. The oil is purified by column chromatography (3.5-cm diameter x 15-cm packed height) on 50 g of silica gel (Note 12) in 5% ethyl acetate-hexane (1:19 ethyl acetate:hexane). The oil is loaded as a solution in ethyl acetate (2 x 1 mL). At this point, 250 mL of fraction is collected with elution of 5% ethyl acetate-hexane (1:19 ethyl acetate:hexane). The eluent containing the product is concentrated by rotary evaporation (36 °C, 20 mmHg) and dried at 0.2 mmHg for 4 h to afford yellow oil (2.8-2.9 g). The oil contains a small amount of ethyl acetate, which cannot be removed under vacuum (Note 20). The material can be used for the next step after co-evaporation with toluene, as described in Step C. Alternatively, crystallization of the oil is facilitated by the following process that involves treatment in ethanol. The yellow oil is transferred to a 100 mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 25 mm x 8 mm). Ethanol (10 mL) is added to the flask, and stirring is initiated. The mixture is refluxed until a homogenous solution results. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature, and stirred to afford a white powder (Note 21). The mixture is cooled to 0 °C in an ice-water bath, and stirring is maintained for 10 min. The precipitate is collected by suction filtration on a Büchner funnel, washed with ice-cold ethanol (3 x 5 mL), and dried for 3 h at 0.2 mmHg (Note 22) to provide 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole (2.7 g, 96%) (Note 23) as a white powder.C. 2-(2-(Dicyclohexylphosphino)phenyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole (CM-phos). An oven-dried 100-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask is charged with 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole (2.3 g, 8.0 mmol) in the form of the oily material described in Step B. The necks are fitted with two glass stoppers. Anhydrous toluene (2 mL) (Note 24) is added to the flask. The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 °C, 20 mmHg). This operation is repeated two additional times (Note 25). The flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 25 mm x 8 mm), glass stoppers are changed to 50-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, rubber septum, and nitrogen stopcock inlet. The flask is evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (40 mL) (Note 16) is added to the reaction flask via syringe to form a solution of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole and stirring is started. The solution is cooled to -78 °C in a dry ice-acetone bath. n-Butyllithium (5.4 mL, 1.63 M in hexane, 8.8 mmol) (Note 26) is added dropwise via dropping funnel over 3 min and additional anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (2 mL) (Note 16) is added to the dropping funnel to rinse all the n-butyllithium solution into the reaction mixture. The resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min at -78 °C. Chlorodicyclohexylphosphine (2.2 mL, 9.6 mmol) (Note 27) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) (Note 16) are added to the dropping funnel to form a solution of chlorodicyclohexylphosphine. The solution is added dropwise via dropping funnel at -78 °C over 3 min, and additional anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (2 mL) (Note 16) is added to the dropping funnel to rinse all phosphine solution to the reaction mixture. The resulting mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature within 2 h and stirred for overnight at 22 °C, at which time TLC analysis indicates completion of the reaction (Notes 18 and 28). After adding methanol (5 mL) to quench the excess n-butyllithium, the reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (36 °C, 20 mmHg) and dried at 0.2 mmHg for 15 min to afford an off-white solid. This solid is cooled in an ice-water bath, and methanol (20 mL) is added with stirring for 30 min to afford an off-white powder. The resulting powder is collected by suction filtration on a Büchner funnel, washed with ice-cold methanol (2 x 5 mL) and ice-cold hexane (5 mL), and dried for 3 h at 0.2 mmHg to give 2-(2-(dicyclohexylphosphino)phenyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole (CM-phos) (2.2-2.4 g, 69-75%) (Notes 29 and 30) as a white powder.

A 500-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 3.5-cm ellipsoidal magnetic stir bar is charged with tetraethylammonium bromide (45 g, 214 mmol) (Note 1), distilled water (5 mL) and fructose (1) (10 g, 0.056 mol) (Note 2). The flask is placed in an oil bath at 100 °C. The reaction temperature is monitored by a thermometer placed inside the reaction mixture. When the internal temperature reaches 90 °C (Note 3), Amberlyst® 15 (1 g, 10%w/w) (Note 4) is added. The stirring is continued for 15 min, during which time the internal temperature reaches 96-98 °C and the color of the reaction mixture turns brown (Note 5). After this period the flask is removed from the heat source and the solution separated from the Amberlyst® 15 by decantation of the hot solution into a 2-L single-necked round-bottomed flask (Note 6). Absolute ethanol (20-30 mL) is used to wash the catalyst after the transfer, and the ethanol is added to the aqueous solution. The reaction mixture is placed on a rotary evaporator for 1 h (15 mmHg, 50 °C) (Note 7). A 3.5-cm ellipsoidal magnetic stir bar is added, and the residue is dissolved in hot absolute anhydrous ethanol (25 mL), which is followed by immediate addition of ethyl acetate (1.5 L) under vigorous stirring. Immediate precipitation of the tetraethylammonium bromide is observed, and the mixture is cooled down to room temperature. The precipitate is vacuum-filtered through a fritted filter and the cake rinsed with ethyl acetate (100 mL) (Note 8). The collected filtrate is vacuum-filtered through a pad of silica gel (30 g) using a fritted filter, and the silica gel is rinsed with ethyl acetate (100 mL) (Notes 9 and 10). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (32 °C, 15 mmHg). The oily residue is transferred into a 50 mL single-necked round-bottomed flask and the residual organic solvent is removed in vacuo (0.5 mmHg). The title compound is obtained as deeply orange liquid (5.8-6.1 g, 83-87%) and 90-92% purity (Note 11). Flash column chromatography (Note 12) was applied to give the title compound as an orange liquid (5.5 g, 79%) with 97% purity (Notes 13, 14 and 15). Figure 1. Reaction Assembly

CA2407806C	Use of heparin or nonanticoagulant heparin for inhibiting apoptosis arising from ischemia perfusion injury	Heparin reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury to myocardium. This effect has been attributed complement inhibition, but heparin also has other activities that might diminish ischemia-reperfusion. To further probe these mechanisms, we compared heparin and an O-desulfated nonanticoagulant heparin with greatly reduced anti-complement activity. Given at the time of coronary artery reperfusion in a canine model of myocardial infarction, both heparin and O-desulfated heparin equally reduced neutrophil adherence to ischemic-reperfused coronary artery endothelium, influx of neutrophils into ischemic-reperfused myocardium, myocardial necrosis and release of creatine kinase into plasma. Heparin and O-desulfated heparin also prevented dysfunction of endothelial-dependent coronary relaxation following ischemic injury. In addition, heparin and O-desulfated heparin inhibited translocation of the transcription factor NF-.KAPPA.B from cytoplasm to the nucleus in human endothelial cells and decreased NF-.KAPPA.B DNA binding in human endothelium and ischemic-reperfused rat myocardium. Thus, heparin and nonanticoagulant heparin decrease ischemia-reperfusion injury by disrupting multiple levels of the inflammatory cascade, including the novel observation that heparins inhibit activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-.KAPPA.B.
