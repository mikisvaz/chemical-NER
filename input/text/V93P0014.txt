V93P0001	Preparation of 2-(2-(Dicyclohexylphosphino)phenyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole (CM-phos)	A. 2-(2-Bromophenyl)-1H-indole. An oven-dried 100-mL single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (oval, 25 mm x 15 mm) is charged with 2-bromoacetophenone (2.7 mL, 4.0 g, 20 mmol) (Note 1) and phenylhydrazine (2.4 mL, 2.6 g, 24 mmol) (Note 2) via syringe, and stirring is started. Phosphoric acid (10.0 mL) (Note 3) is added slowly over 1 min, and the mixture is stirred for 50 min (Note 4). Polyphosphoric acid (56.7 g, Note 5) is added to the reaction mixture slowly over 30 min with continuous stirring (Note 6). The reaction flask is equipped with a Dimroth condenser, and is placed in a pre-heated oil bath (85 ºC). The bath temperature is raised to 120 °C within 1 h under air atmosphere (Note 7). The resulting mixture is stirred at 120 °C for an additional 2 h, and then carefully poured into ice water (90 g ice, 20 mL water) in a 300 mL beaker (Note 8) with stirring by means of a glass rod (Note 9). The remaining crude product in the reaction flask is rinsed with water (3 x 10 mL) (Note 10) and dichloromethane (3 x 10 mL). All rinses are transferred to the beaker. The resulting mixture is stirred by means of a glass rod for 30 min (Note 11), and then poured into 500-mL separatory funnel. The beaker is rinsed with dichloromethane (3 x 10 mL), water (3 x 10 mL), and again dichloromethane (100 mL). All rinses are transferred to the separatory funnel. The funnel is shaken, and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is further extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 100 mL). The combined organic extracts are concentrated by rotary evaporation (37 °C, 52 mmHg). The resulting dark-brown residues are purified by column chromatography (4.5-cm diameter x 16-cm packed height) with 81 g of silica gel (Note 12) in 10% ethyl acetate-hexane (1:9 ethyl acetate:hexane). At this point, 1400 mL is collected with elution of 10% ethyl acetate-hexane (1:9 ethyl acetate:hexane). The eluent containing the product is concentrated by rotary evaporation (37 °C, 20 mmHg) to afford an orange-yellow oil and dried at 7 mmHg for 1 h. This oil is cooled in an ice-water bath, and hexane (20 mL) is added with stirring by means of a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 25 mm x 8 mm) for 1 h to afford an off-white powder. The resulting powder is collected by suction filtration on a funnel, washed with ice-cold hexane (3 x 5 mL), dried for 5 h at 0.2 mmHg to provide the crude material as a pale yellow powder (3.5-3.7 g, 64-68%) (Note 13). The crude powder (3.6 g) is suspended in hexane (20 mL) and vigorously stirred for 1 h with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 25 mm x 8 mm). The resulting white powder is collected by suction filtration on a funnel, washed with ice-cold hexane (3 x 5 mL), and dried for 7 h at 0.2 mmHg to provide 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole (2.3 g, 42%) (Note 14).B. 2-(2-Bromophenyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole. An oven-dried 100-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 25 mm x 8 mm), is charged with sodium hydride (63 % dispersion in mineral oil) (0.46 g of the sodium hydride in oil, 12 mmol) (Note 15). The necks are fitted with a glass stopper, a rubber septum and a nitrogen stopcock inlet. The flask is evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Sodium hydride is washed free of mineral oil by stirring with distilled hexane (10 mL), and the supernatant liquid is decanted. This operation is repeated for three times. The remaining solvent is removed by placing the flask under vacuum (0.2 mmHg) for 15 min, after which the flask is filled with nitrogen. The glass stopper is removed and 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel attached (Figure 1). The flask is evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) (Note 16) is added to the reaction flask via syringe to form a suspension of sodium hydride, and stirring is started. The suspension is cooled to 0 °C in an ice-water bath. Figure 1. Apparatus Assembly for Step B A separate oven-dried 100 mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 25 mm x 8 mm) and charged with 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole (2.7 g, 10 mmol). The necks are fitted with a rubber septum and a nitrogen stopcock inlet. The flask is evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) (Note 16) is added via syringe, and stirring is started, to form a solution of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole. The solution of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole is transferred to the dropping funnel via cannula and additional anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) (Note 16) is added to the two-necked flask to rinse all the 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole solution to the dropping funnel. The solution of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole is added dropwise via the dropping funnel to the reaction mixture over 5 min and additional anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) (Note 16) is added to the dropping funnel to rinse all the 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1H-indole solution to the reaction mixture. Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 30 min. Dimethyl sulfate (0.99 mL, 10.3 mmol) (Note 17) is added via syringe to the reaction mixture. The mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature, at which time TLC analysis indicates the reaction has been completed (Notes 18 and 19). After adding methanol (5 mL) to quench the excess sodium hydride, the reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (36 °C, 20 mmHg) to afford a brown oil. This oil is diluted with ethyl acetate (20 mL), and then transferred to a 300-mL separatory funnel. The reaction flask is rinsed with ethyl acetate (2 x 20 mL), deionized water (2 x 20 mL), and again ethyl acetate (20 mL). All rinses are transferred to the separatory funnel. The funnel is shaken, and the layers are separated. The aqueous phase is separated out and the organic phase is washed with water (2 x 20 mL) and brine (20 mL). The organic extract is concentrated by rotary evaporation (36 °C, 20 mmHg) to afford a brown oil. The oil is purified by column chromatography (3.5-cm diameter x 15-cm packed height) on 50 g of silica gel (Note 12) in 5% ethyl acetate-hexane (1:19 ethyl acetate:hexane). The oil is loaded as a solution in ethyl acetate (2 x 1 mL). At this point, 250 mL of fraction is collected with elution of 5% ethyl acetate-hexane (1:19 ethyl acetate:hexane). The eluent containing the product is concentrated by rotary evaporation (36 °C, 20 mmHg) and dried at 0.2 mmHg for 4 h to afford yellow oil (2.8-2.9 g). The oil contains a small amount of ethyl acetate, which cannot be removed under vacuum (Note 20). The material can be used for the next step after co-evaporation with toluene, as described in Step C. Alternatively, crystallization of the oil is facilitated by the following process that involves treatment in ethanol. The yellow oil is transferred to a 100 mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 25 mm x 8 mm). Ethanol (10 mL) is added to the flask, and stirring is initiated. The mixture is refluxed until a homogenous solution results. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature, and stirred to afford a white powder (Note 21). The mixture is cooled to 0 °C in an ice-water bath, and stirring is maintained for 10 min. The precipitate is collected by suction filtration on a Büchner funnel, washed with ice-cold ethanol (3 x 5 mL), and dried for 3 h at 0.2 mmHg (Note 22) to provide 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole (2.7 g, 96%) (Note 23) as a white powder.C. 2-(2-(Dicyclohexylphosphino)phenyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole (CM-phos). An oven-dried 100-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask is charged with 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole (2.3 g, 8.0 mmol) in the form of the oily material described in Step B. The necks are fitted with two glass stoppers. Anhydrous toluene (2 mL) (Note 24) is added to the flask. The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 °C, 20 mmHg). This operation is repeated two additional times (Note 25). The flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 25 mm x 8 mm), glass stoppers are changed to 50-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, rubber septum, and nitrogen stopcock inlet. The flask is evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (40 mL) (Note 16) is added to the reaction flask via syringe to form a solution of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole and stirring is started. The solution is cooled to -78 °C in a dry ice-acetone bath. n-Butyllithium (5.4 mL, 1.63 M in hexane, 8.8 mmol) (Note 26) is added dropwise via dropping funnel over 3 min and additional anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (2 mL) (Note 16) is added to the dropping funnel to rinse all the n-butyllithium solution into the reaction mixture. The resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min at -78 °C. Chlorodicyclohexylphosphine (2.2 mL, 9.6 mmol) (Note 27) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) (Note 16) are added to the dropping funnel to form a solution of chlorodicyclohexylphosphine. The solution is added dropwise via dropping funnel at -78 °C over 3 min, and additional anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (2 mL) (Note 16) is added to the dropping funnel to rinse all phosphine solution to the reaction mixture. The resulting mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature within 2 h and stirred for overnight at 22 °C, at which time TLC analysis indicates completion of the reaction (Notes 18 and 28). After adding methanol (5 mL) to quench the excess n-butyllithium, the reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (36 °C, 20 mmHg) and dried at 0.2 mmHg for 15 min to afford an off-white solid. This solid is cooled in an ice-water bath, and methanol (20 mL) is added with stirring for 30 min to afford an off-white powder. The resulting powder is collected by suction filtration on a Büchner funnel, washed with ice-cold methanol (2 x 5 mL) and ice-cold hexane (5 mL), and dried for 3 h at 0.2 mmHg to give 2-(2-(dicyclohexylphosphino)phenyl)-1-methyl-1H-indole (CM-phos) (2.2-2.4 g, 69-75%) (Notes 29 and 30) as a white powder.
