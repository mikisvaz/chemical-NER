V92P0001	Iridium-Catalyzed Enantioselective Allylic Vinylation with Potassium Alkenyltrifluoroborates	A. 1-(Naphthalen-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-ol (1). An oven-dried 250 mL round-bottomed flask, fitted with a rubber septum, is charged with a 2.5 cm Teflon-coated magnetic oval stir bar and 2-naphthaldehyde (4.69 g, 30.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 1). The flask is flushed with nitrogen via a nitrogen line inlet and charged with anhydrous THF (60 mL) via a 60 mL syringe (Note 2). The stirred homogeneous solution (Note 3) is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath (−78 °C bath temp), and vinylmagnesium chloride solution (20.6 mL, 33.0 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is added dropwise over 20 min via a syringe. The resulting clear yellow solution is stirred at −78 °C for 1 h and then at 0 °C in an ice bath for 30 min (Note 4). The reaction mixture is quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (30 mL) and diluted with H2O (30 mL). After being warmed up to ambient temperature, the mixture is transferred to a 250 mL separatory funnel. Additional diethyl ether (20 mL) is used to assist transfer. The aqueous layer is separated and further extracted with diethyl ether (2 x 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous NaCl solution (50 mL), dried over sodium sulfate (20 g), filtered through a 150 mL coarse porosity sintered glass funnel, and concentrated using a rotary evaporator (25 °C, 25 mmHg) to afford a yellow oil (Note 5). This crude product is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to afford 1 (5.23-5.35 g, 95-97%) as a colorless oil (Note 6).B. (R)-(−)-(3,5-Dioxa-4-phospha-cyclohepta[2,1-a;3,4-a']dinaphthalen-4-yl)-dibenzo[b,f]-azepine ((R)-L). An oven-dried 100 mL Schlenk flask, fitted with a rubber septum, is charged with a 2.5 cm Teflon-coated magnetic oval stir bar and (R)-(+)-1,1′-bi(2-naphthol) (2.29 g, 8.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) (Note 7). The side arm of the flask, fitted with a glass stopcock, is connected to a vacuum/N2 line. The flask is evacuated and refilled with nitrogen 3 times. Phosphorus trichloride (10.5 mL, 16.5 g, 15 equiv) and anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (19 µL, 18 mg, 0.24 mmol, 0.03 equiv) are added by syringes through the septum. The reaction mixture is stirred (Note 8) at 50 °C in an oil bath for 30 min, during which time it becomes a colorless homogeneous solution. Excess phosphorus trichloride is removed via vacuum distillation (Notes 9 and 10) and azeotropic removal with toluene (2 x 3 mL) under high vacuum (see photograph) (Notes 11 and 12) to afford the phosphochloridite as an oily foam. A separate oven-dried 250 mL round-bottomed flask is charged with a 2.5 cm Teflon-coated magnetic oval stir bar and 5H-dibenz[b,f ]azepine (1.70 g, 8.80 mmol, 1.1 equiv). The flask is fitted with a rubber septum with a nitrogen line inlet and flushed with nitrogen. Anhydrous THF (47 mL) is added by syringe, and the stirred orange solution is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath (−78 °C bath temp) (Note 13). n-Butyllithium (5.50 mL, 8.80 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is then added dropwise over 10 min with a syringe, and the resulting dark blue solution is stirred at −78 °C for 1 h. The phosphochloridite prepared as above is dissolved in anhydrous THF (37 mL) and added to the deprotonated 5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine solution at −78 °C dropwise via a cannula over 20 min. Additional anhydrous THF (10 mL) is used to assist transfer. The dark blue solution is stirred for 12 h while being gradually warmed to ambient temperature (Note 14). Silica gel (20 g) is added to the orange reaction mixture, and the resulting slurry is carefully concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 25 mmHg). Flash chromatography on silica gel yields (R)-L (2.96-3.07 g, 73-75%) as a white solid (Note 15).C. (S,E)-2-(1-Phenylpenta-1,4-dien-3-yl)naphthalene (2). A screw cap 100 mL cylindrical polyethylene bottle (diameter: 4.5 cm, height: 9.5 cm) with a 4 cm Teflon-coated magnetic cylindrical stir bar is charged with bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)diiridium dichloride (0.725 g, 1.08 mmol, 0.04 equiv), (R)-L (2.19 g, 4.32 mmol, 0.16 equiv) and 1,4-dioxane (34 mL) (Note 16). The resulting dark brown solution (see photograph) is stirred for 15 min (Note 17). 1-(Naphthalen-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-ol (1) (4.97 g, 27.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv), potassium trans-styryltrifluoroborate (8.51 g, 40.5 mmol, 1.5 equiv), tetrabutylammonium bromide (0.87 g, 2.7 mmol, 0.1 equiv) and potassium hydrogen difluoride (3.16 g, 40.5 mmol, 1.5 equiv) are sequentially added, and additional 1,4-dioxane (2.0 mL) is added to rinse the reaction vessel wall. To the resulting stirred dark-yellow heterogeneous mixture is added trifluoroacetic acid (5.17 mL, 7.70 g, 67.5 mmol, 2.5 equiv) dropwise. The red heterogeneous mixture is vigorously stirred for 6 h, during which time it gradually turns light yellow (Note 18). Upon completion of the reaction, excess trifluoroacetic acid is quenched by addition of triethylamine (5 mL), and the heterogeneous mixture is filtered through a short silica pad (Note 19). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 25 mmHg). The concentrate is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to afford 2 (5.74 g, 79%) as a white solid (Notes 20 and 21).
